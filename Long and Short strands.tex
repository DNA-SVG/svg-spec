\title{Split Long and Merge Short strands}
\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    We can get a encoded DNA list from the work we have done,but there is a problem that the actual DNA length of strands is negated. So we split long strands and merge short strands for addressing this issue.
    \par Suppose that the Min Length is 150 and Max length is 300. Then 1nt is used to record the type of strands. A for normal, T for long, C for short.
    \par 
    \textbf{Split Long Strands:} split the long stands to several strands. If the the last one is short, then make the last two strands half.
    \emph{Structure: T + (the id of the original strands) + (the order of current processed strands) + content}
    \par 
    \textbf{Merge Short Strands:} merge the short ones
    \emph{Structure : C + (the encoded number of original strands length + content) for each short strands}
